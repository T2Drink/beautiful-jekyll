In this article, i discuss how i overcame some hurdles with mobile blogging, the way i wanted it, and the awesome service that helped me do it. All for 1 pound a year

### What i wanted from a blog
I had my heart set on having continuous integration on a fast static page blog. I found Gatsby and decided to use it as the generator, but where was i going to host it?  
There was a big loophole in my mobile setup, for blogging on the go. I was having to remote into my Windows PC to run builds or remote to a server and do it there.

#### What Am I Using?
For those of you who don’t know i’m using a 2016 iPad Pro and have managed to adapt it to allot of use cases (*mainly* due to owning an Apple Pencil and Bluetooth keyboard). It has, by all intents and purposes, become my main machine. I have not turned on my Windows machine to use it directly in a few weeks now.  

## In Comes Netlify  
  

In my pursuit of my lightning fast, version controlled blog, i never in my **WILDEST** dreams imagined that i would find a service like Netifly.
They are a service that is geared towards hosting static site generators such as Gatsby or Jekyll.
They support Continuous deployment from Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab. You can use your own domain. along with a free LetsEncrypt Certificate. They will even give you a “staging area” of sorts, by allowing you to preview your other branches (development) etc on a dynamically created URL. This can be triggered by commit or a simple web-hook.

### And How Much Does This Cost? 

It sounds expensive, it acts like it’s expensive, but if you are a solo operation (like me), it is free! Everything...

### What’s The Catch?
Put simply, i haven’t found any yet. I will let you know if i come across any. At this moment i am a very happy blogger. I will keep you posted with any updates on this as they come along..
